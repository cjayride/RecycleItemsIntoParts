# v1.5.0 - 2024/4/7
- Change for EpicLoot, committed by blradlof (verfied by "aedenthorn") on Dec 16, 2023. Line 86 changed EpicLoot.Crafting.EnchantTabController to EpicLoot.Crafting.EnchantHelper

# v1.4.0 - 2023/7/9
- Update for Mistlands. I've tested it with a combination of mods like EpicLoot, EquipmentandQuickSlots, ExtendedPlayerInventory, BetterArchery. 
- Note: The BetterArchery QUIVER (if enabled) breaks the game if ExtendedPlayerInventor is also installed.
- I'll continue to test as I complete the rebuild of CJAYCRAFT modpack. As far as I can tell, this mod is working, but shoot me a message if you discover an issue before I get to play more :)
